In this exercise, we want to implement an algorithm called k-nearest neighbor or k-NN which is one of the common machine learning algorithms.
By doing this exercise, we will review topics such as vector calculations with the help of spreading arrays, the use of aggregate and general functions, and indexing with the help of arrays in numpy.
